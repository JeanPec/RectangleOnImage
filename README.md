# ProjectSylvainDerory

This Project is a WPF Application, in this project you can load an Image.
Draw Rectangle on the image,you can then manage this rectangles, resize 
them, move them and modify their colors. Once you are done you can 
Download the image you created. The Exe is inside the the folder 
of the Solution.

Some points that can be added later on is the possibility to add
different kind of forms ellipsis, line, stars ...
Adding Shape is nice it could be even better if we could in the
future add Text, take inspiration in Paint to add more features.
It would be good too to create our own Window title bar so that
we can modify the color, add options directly on the bar (Save, Download ...)
One point that could be improved is when you save the file, you
should be able to modify the rectangles once you load it again
